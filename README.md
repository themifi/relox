# Relox

**Re**implementation of the **lox** programming language.

[Crafting interpreters book](https://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) explains how to implement the lox programming language and all its parts from scratch. I'll write my own implementation here in [the Rust programming lanugage](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The lox programming language:

- is a scripting language
- shares C-like syntax
- is dynamically typed
- is garbage collected
